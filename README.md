## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Riccardo but I go by Ricky. I love R and cryptocurrencies. 
### Below is a price chart of Ethereum prices, powered by R, GitHub actions and MySQL, which updates once every hour (check the timestamp on the latest data in the subtitle of the chart below):

The past ~4 months of data are being shown, and the image updates hourly.

Be sure to create a new repository named the same as your GitHub username with a readme.md in order to get this to appear on your profile, forking this or a different repository will not work.
